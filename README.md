## Minimal character-level Vanilla RNN model.

RNN stand for "Recurent Neural Network".  
To understand why RNN are so hot you _must_ read [this](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/)!  

This notebook to explain the _[Minimal character-level Vanilla RNN model](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/d4dee566867f8291f086)_ written by __Andrej Karpathy__  
This code create a RNN to generate a text, char after char, by learning char after char from a textfile.

I love this _character-level Vanilla RNN_ code because it doesn't use any library except numpy.
All the NN magic in 112 lines of code, no need to understand any dependency. Everything is there! I'll try to explain in detail every line of it. Disclamer: I still need to use some external links for reference.  

This notebook is for real beginners who whant to understand RNN concept by reading code.
